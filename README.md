# iOS-Location-Updates-Testing
A simple project for testing the Speed and Horizontal Accuracy of the Location Services in iOS, using a Swift App.

If you're interested in understanding the Location Services of iOS, take a look at the ViewController.swift file.

You will find there how to:

* Set up the location services
* Manage permissions from the user
* Process change in permissions
* Process location updates (each time the user moves, a new location point is generated)
* Draw the points in a map.
